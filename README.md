<h3 align="center"> Hi there, I'm Anjishnu 👋🏻 </h3>

I'm a senior year computer science undergrad from India. My interests lie at the
intersection of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics, with particular interests
in Generative Modelling and AI in medicine initiatives. Currently working on my
final year thesis centered around the topic of AI & HealthCare. Feel free to
shoot me an email !!

I love watching movies in the fictional/fantasy genre mostly.
